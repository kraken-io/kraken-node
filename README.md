## Getting Started

First you need to sign-up for the [Kraken API](http://kraken.io/plans/) and obtain your unique **API Key** and **API Secret**. You will find both under [API Credentials](http://kraken.io/account/api-credentials). Once you have set up your account, you can start using Kraken API in your applications.

## Optimization Process

**JPEG Images**

For JPEGs Kraken does a vast array of optimizations. It strips all metadata found in a given image, optimizes Huffman tables, converts image to progressive format and tries a variety of custom progressive scans to find best structure per image.

For lossy JPEG optimizations we additionaly use `imgmin` library by Ryan Flynn which generates multiple copies of the input image using different quality settings. Then it intelligently picks the one with the best quality to size ratio. This ensures your JPEG image will be at the smallest size with the highest possible quality, without the need for a human to select the optimal image.

**PNG Images**

Kraken dynamically chooses best compression and optimization algorithms and their optimal settings for a given PNG to ensure an outstanding image quality with the minimum file weight.

**GIF Images**

Since Kraken supports GIF to PNG8 conversion and optimization (because PNGs are almost always superior to GIFs) your static GIF images will be returned as optimized PNG files. In this case you have to change file extensions in your websites or applications.

Optimized GIF animations will always be returned as standard animation GIF files.

## Installation

    npm install kraken --save

## How to use

You can optimize your images in two ways - by providing an URL of the image you want to optimize or by uploading an image file directly to Kraken API.

The first option (image URL) is great for images that are already in production or any other place on the Internet. The second one (direct upload) is ideal for your deployment process, build script or the on-the-fly processing of your user's uploads where you don't have the images available online yet.

## Wait and Callback URL

Kraken gives you two options for fetching optimization results. With the `wait` option set the results will be returned immediately in the response. With the `callback_url` option set the results will be posted to the URL specified in your request.

### Wait option

With the `wait` option turned on for every request to the API, the connection will be held open unil the image has been optimized. Once this is done you will get an immediate response with a JSON object containing your optimization results. To use this option simply set `"wait": true` in your request.

**Request:**

````js
{
    "auth": {
        "api_key": "your-api-key",
        "api_secret": "your-api-secret"
    },
    "url": "http://awesome-website.com/images/header.jpg",
    "wait": true
}
````

**Response**

````js
{
    "success": true,
    "file_name": "header.jpg",
    "original_size": 324520,
    "kraked_size": 165358,
    "saved_bytes": 159162,
    "kraked_url": "https://api.kraken.io/d1aacd2a2280c2ffc7b4906a09f78f46/header.jpg"
}
````

### Callback URL

With the Callback URL the HTTPS connection will be terminated immediately and a unique `id` will be returned in the response body. After the optimization is over Kraken will POST a message to the `callback_url` specified in your request. The ID in the response will reflect the ID in the results posted to your Callback URL.

We recommend [requestb.in](http://requestb.in) as an easy way to capture optimization results for initial testing.

**Request:**

````js
{
    "auth": {
        "api_key": "your-api-key",
        "api_secret": "your-api-secret"
    },
    "url": "http://image-url.com/file.jpg",
    "callback_url": "http://awesome-website.com/kraken_results"
}
````

**Response:**

````js
{
    "id": "18fede37617a787649c3f60b9f1f280d"
}
````

**Results posted to the Callback URL:**

````js
{
    "id": "18fede37617a787649c3f60b9f1f280d"
    "success": true,
    "file_name": "file.jpg",
    "original_size": 324520,
    "kraked_size": 165358,
    "saved_bytes": 159162,
    "kraked_url": "https://api.kraken.io/18fede37617a787649c3f60b9f1f280d/file.jpg"
}
````

## Authentication

The first step is to authenticate to Kraken API by providing your unique API Key and API Secret while creating a new Kraken instance:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});
````

## Usage - Image URL

To optimize an image by providing image URL use the `kraken.url()` method. You will need to provide two mandatory parameters - `url` to the image and `wait` or `callback_url`:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});

var opts = {
    url: 'http://image-url.com/file.jpg',
    wait: true
};

kraken.url(opts, function(data) {
    if (data.success) {
        console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', data.kraked_url);
    } else {
        console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', data.error);
    }
});
````

Depending on a choosen response option (Wait or Callback URL) in the `data` object you will find either the optimization ID or optimization results containing a `success` property, file name, original file size, kraked file size, amount of savings and optimized image URL:

````js
{
    success: true,
    file_name: 'file.jpg',
    original_size: 30664,
    kraked_size: 577,
    saved_bytes: 30087,
    kraked_url: 'https://api.kraken.io/d1aacd2a2280c2ffc7b4906a09f78f46/file.jpg'
}
````

If no saving were found, the API will return an object containing `"success":false` and a proper error message:

````js
{
    success: false,
    error: 'This image can not be optimized any further'
}
````

## Usage - Image Upload

If you want to upload your images directly to Kraken API use the `kraken.upload()` method. You will need to provide two mandatory parameters - `file` which is the absolute path to the file and `wait` or `callback_url`.

In the `data` object you will find the same optimization properties as with `url` option above.

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});

var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    wait: true
};

kraken.upload(opts, function(data) {
    if (data.success) {
        console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', data.kraked_url);
    } else {
        console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', data.error);
    }
});
````

## Lossy Optimization

When you decide to sacrifice just a small amount of image quality (usually unnoticeable to the human eye), you will be able to save up to 90% of the initial file weight. Lossy optimization will give you outstanding results with just a fraction of image quality loss.

To use lossy optimizations simply set `lossy: true` in your request:

````js
var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    lossy: true,
    wait: true
};
````

### PNG Images
PNG images will be converted from 24-bit to paletted 8-bit with full alpha channel. This process is called PNG quantization in RGBA format and means the amout of colours used in an image will be reduced to 256 while maintaining all information about alpha transparency.

### JPEG Images
For lossy JPEG optimizations we use [imgmin](https://github.com/rflynn/imgmin) library by Ryan Flynn which generates multiple copies of the input image using different quality settings. Then it intelligently picks the one with the best quality to size ratio. This ensures your JPEG image will be at the smallest size with the highest possible quality, without the need for a human to select the optimal image.

## Image Resizing

Image resizing option is great for creating thumbnails or preview images in your applications. Kraken will first resize the given image and then optimize it with its vast array of optimization algorithms. The `resize` option needs a few parameters to be passed like desired `width` and/or `height` and a mandatory `strategy` property. For example:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});

var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    wait: true,
    resize: {
        width: 100,
        height: 75,
        strategy: 'crop'
    }
};

kraken.upload(opts, function(data) {
    if (data.success) {
        console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', data.kraked_url);
    } else {
        console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', data.error);
    }
});
````

The `strategy` property can have one of the following values:

- `exact` - Resize by exact width/height. No aspect ratio will be maintained.
- `portrait` - Exact width will be set, height will be adjusted according to aspect ratio.
- `landscape` - Exact height will be set, width will be adjusted according to aspect ratio.
- `auto` - The best strategy (portrait or landscape) will be selected for a given image according to aspect ratio.
- `crop` - This option will crop your image to the exact size you specify with no distortion.

## WebP Compression

WebP is a new image format introduced by Google in 2010 which supports both lossy and lossless compression. According to [Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/), WebP lossless images are **26% smaller** in size compared to PNGs and WebP lossy images are **25-34% smaller** in size compared to JPEG images.

To recompress your PNG or JPEG files into WebP format simply set `"webp": true` flag in your request JSON. You can also optionally set `"lossy": true` flag to leverage WebP's lossy compression:

````js
var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    wait: true,
    webp: true,
    lossy: true
};
````

## Amazon S3 and Rackspace Cloud Files

Kraken API allows you to store optimized images directly in your S3 bucket or Cloud Files container. With just a few additional parameters your optimized images will be pushed to your external storage in no time.

### Amazon S3

**Mandatory Parameters:**
- `key` - Your unique Amazon "Access Key ID".
- `secret` - Your unique Amazon "Secret Access Key".
- `bucket` - Name of a destination container on your Amazon S3 account.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `path` - Destination path in your S3 bucket (e.g. `"images/layout/header.jpg"`). Defaults to root `"/"`.
- `acl` - Permissions of a destination object. This can be `"public_read"` or `"private"`. Defaults to `"public_read"`.

The above parameters must be passed in a `s3_store` object:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});

var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    wait: true,
    s3_store: {
        key: 'your-amazon-access-key',
        secret: 'your-amazon-secret-key',
        bucket: 'destination-bucket'
    }
};

kraken.upload(opts, function(data) {
    if (data.success) {
        console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', data.kraked_url);
    } else {
        console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', data.error);
    }
});
````

The `data` object will contain `kraked_url` key pointing directly to the optimized file in your Amazon S3 account:

````js
{
    kraked_url: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_CONTAINER/path/to/file.jpg"
}
````

### Rackspace Cloud Files

**Mandatory Parameters:**
- `user` - Your Rackspace username.
- `key` - Your unique Cloud Files API Key.
- `container` - Name of a destination container on your Cloud Files account.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `path` - Destination path in your container (e.g. `"images/layout/header.jpg"`). Defaults to root `"/"`.

The above parameters must be passed in a `cf_store` object:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
    api_key: 'your-api-key',
    api_secret: 'your-api-secret'
});

var opts = {
    file: '/path/to/image/file.jpg',
    wait: true,
    cf_store: {
        user: 'your-rackspace-username',
        key: 'your-rackspace-api-key',
        container: 'destination-container'
    }
};

kraken.upload(opts, function(data) {
    if (data.success) {
        console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', data.kraked_url);
    } else {
        console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', data.error);
    }
});
````

The `data` object will contain `kraked_url` pointing directly to the optimized file in your Rackspace Cloud Files account:

````js
{
    kraked_url: "http://e9ffc04970a269a54eeb-cc00fdd2d4f11dffd931005c9e8de53a.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/path/to/file.jpg"
}
````
